         His father was 1st Lt James W. Gulick CSA, Confederate officer of Goldsboro NC, b. NJ. 
         Some surprising family resemblance to Professor Henry C. Gulick (father). 
         Fort Gulick in Panama Canal Zone was named after Major General John W. Gulick.
         Mutual Descent from Jochem (ca 1645-1723, Captain of Militia Gravesend Long Island 1705) and (Van Pelt) Gulick... Gulicks owned slaves (cousin? Cornelius Gulick  5 
          slaves 1830 Franklin Twp Somerset Co NJ just NE of Princeton) 
          in America in the 19th century in NJ & northern Virginia.

            <h3>General John Hunt Morgan, KY CSA</h3>
            <h4>Representing paternal great grandmother Josephine GARNER Gulick. 
              Her father was a Confederate soldier from Bath Co KY ("he fought on horseback locally, was shot in leg..."), Isaac D. Garner (1831 - d. Warrensburg MO 1921, his uncle Isaac Garner, 1850 Wyoming Bath Co KY, 2 slaves). 
              Two of his wife's brothers were Confederate regulars from Bath County: Felix Nestor was with
               Confederate General John Hunt Morgan KY Cavalry (2nd Battalion Mounted Rifles KY Volunteers CSA) & "killed in battle, June 1864" on Morgan's 
               last Kentucky raid (Mt Sterling, Lexington, CYNTHIANA, Hazel Green), abt. age 18 or 19 (actually, 
                may? have survived the war). 
               Joshua Nestor was with Co H 5th KY Inf CSA of the Kentucky "Orphan Brigade". On the maternal side, 
                the nephew of Jane Poole Clark, James Monroe Poole (b. Christian Co KY), 
               was also with Morgan on his 1864 raid... History of Kansas under Henry F. Gulick says Isaac Garner was Confederate soldier. It sounds like he may have 
   been a Confederate Partisan guerilla or maybe in the 2nd Battalion Mounted Rifles KY Volunteers CSA?
