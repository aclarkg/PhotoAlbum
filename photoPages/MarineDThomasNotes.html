Some of these Thomases moved from Fred. Co VA to Loudoun Co starting ca 1791.

From History of Davidson Co TN - "[JOSHUA] THOMAS was one of the most active and daring of the defenders of the infant settlements. Several of his family had already been killed [?bros James & Eneas Thomas & Capt Wm Overall]. His death was due to his imprudence in not taking a tree in the fight at the Narrows [Nickajack], as he was urged to do by Edmond Jennings, who had been his almost constant companion for years. "... COLONEL WILLIAM PILLOW (b. Guilford Co NC 1772 d. near Bigbyville Maury Co TN 1868, m. 1812 Portia THOMAS b. 1779 dau of Jesse & Mary Howell Thomas, Portia was sister of Job H. Thomas, etc...; 36 slaves Maury Co District 7 1850) -  "At length Big Foot, in the ardor of revenge, pressed forward among the whites and engaged in a hand-to-hand struggle with Luke Anderson for the possession of the latter's gun. Being of superior strength he was on the point of wresting it away, when WM PILLOW sprang to the rescue and sank his tomahawk deeply into the Indian's brain. At the fall of their leader his followers withdrew from the conflict with loud yells of disappointed rage, leaving 5 of their number dead on the field." Nephew Maj General Gideon Johnson Pillow CSA.

<h2>FINAL SUMMARY</h2> of possible THOMAS Genealogy, 4/7/2016, with all known available info: the 5 Thomas lines found S of Columbia TN in early 19th Cent appear to have the following origins (from 3 lines of Quaker gentry ?cousins who emigrated from SW Wales 1680's to SE PA - 1 Evan/Daniel sons of Evan Thomas of Llan-y-cefn, ?2 Wm Thomas (?or alias Rhydderch/Prothero - see N.A. Thomas page) m. Eliz Philips, & 3 James Thomas of Llanboidy m. Margaret Howell; the ?cousins of Rees Thomas m. Martha Aubrey, prob? desc of (Richard) Thomas of Llanbradach) -
<br><br>
1) Sarah THOMAS Brown (m. Col Jos. Brown), dau of John Thomas (d. 1803 TN) & Sarah HUMPHREYS - prob a desc of Wm Thomas (alias ?[P]Rhydderch, ?maternal cousins) who m. Eliz Philips & his son Philip m. Esther, explicitly named in 1 source; assoc with OVERALL family in TN.
<br><br>
2) Capt Wm & Marine D. THOMAS - prob desc of Evan Thomas of Hopewell, Fred Co VA (?son of Evan of Llanykeaven) & his son John; assoc with MORRIS & REES (Evan THOMAS of Hopewell dau Martha m. 1758 Henry REES, gson of Thomas REES, gent. servant of Evan Thomas of Llanycefn, ...) families in VA, & OVERALL family in VA & TN. Also DRAPER & RICHARDSON assoc TN.
<br><br>
3) Col Jonas E THOMAS - info points to prob desc of Daniel Thomas (son of Evan of Llanykeaven) & his son ?Caleb, or other; gfather Capt John Thomas of Loudoun Co VA assoc with POTTS family.
<br><br>
4) Job H. Thomas - points to gfather Job (b. ca 1730 Lancaster Co PA) prob son of John Thomas (& Evan) of Hopewell due to John's strong assoc with HIATT family that was in Lancaster Co PA 1730. Also assoc with HOGGATT family of VA, including that of John Thomas of Hopewell, the Hiatts & Hoggatt cousins at New Garden Mtg, Guilford Co NC.
<br><br>
5) Isaac J. & James H. THOMAS - ancestor Jacob Thomas most looking like desc of James Thomas of Llanboidy/Merion m. Howell, but could be ?other; assoc with Welsh LEWIS & REES (possibly same Rees family as #2 line above) families.
<br><br>
Significant genealogical documentation might have been lost by the fire that destroyed Quaker records ca 1758 Hopewell VA. Marine D., Col Jonas, & Job H. THOMAS esp always appeared like close cousins due to living less than 1 mile from each other at 1 time near Bigbyville TN & other assoc - all 3 prob? desc of EVAN THOMAS of Llanycefn Pembrokeshire Wales.
<br><br>
Quakerism - 2 of the Thomas lines dropped out early 1700's (James m. Howell & Wm m. Eliz Philips lines); the Potts family, assoc with the Jonas (& Daniel) Thomas line, seemed to have dropped out in Loudoun Co VA ?late 1750's; some of the Evan Thomas line remained Quakers at least until the death of John m. Alice Hiatt  ca 1782 - Anne Thomas Overall (b. ca 1760 ?old Fred Co VA, ?sis of Capt Wm) was described as "a Quaker" in TN .

*(5) This Wm Thomas might be father of Capt Wm Thomas. Since both sons of Evan Thomas of Llanykeaven (Daniel II & Evan of Hopewell) have a number of pedigrees claiming each one was married to a Morris, it seems there is a good chance that Wm Thomas & Israel Morris were cousins.

Thomas of Llanb. also intermarried with Lewis of Van, who bought S. Fagans castle now the Folk Museum of Wales, which may be why Thomas of Llanb. favored the 1st name of Lewis for some generations.

*(8) Rev. John Taylor quote on living near Front Royal VA late 1750's - early 1760's: "... & in the early part of my life my lot was cast in the backwoods of Virginia where Indians often killed people not far from where I was... we lived so frontier, I never heard a preacher til 17 [1769] ..."

*(11) LINK: this New Garden Mtg NC Anthony HOGGATT (b. 1730 Cedar Cr, Hanover Co VA) appears to be a son of Phillip Hoggatt. Phillip's prob brother planter "Gent." Anthony (d. 1755 VA) was the father of Elizabeth Hoggatt who married (2) JOB THOMAS ca 1750 Goochland/Cumberland Co VA, making Elizabeth & this Anthony 1st cousins. By my genealogy, JOB THOMAS was possibly a son of John (m. Alice) THOMAS who moved from Hopewell VA to New Garden Mtg NC & gson of Evan Thomas Sr of Hopewell VA.
