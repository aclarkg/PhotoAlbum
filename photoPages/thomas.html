          <h4>Flower of the Welsh chivalry. Pronounced Sir "REESE" ap Thomas?
          The REESE family, THOMAS associates, were ?probably paternal descendants of David the Younger, a son of Sir Rhys ap Thomas... <br>Many <b>DNA MATCHES</b> on descendants 
              of Thomas REESE (ca 1671-1713) 
              and his father David REESE (ca 1650-1706), associates of ancestor Evan THOMAS of Llanycefn. REESE ancestor was probably Eliz, mother of 4th g grandfather Capt Wm THOMAS... Also numerous 
              <b> DNA MATCHES</b> to Moses BOWEN (b. Wales ca 1674 d. VA 1761) and wife Rebecca REESE, probably because of Rebecca being daughter of David REESE (ca 1650-1706) 
              and aunt to Henry REESE (son of Thomas and Margaret Bowen REESE, m. Martha THOMAS 1758 daughter of ancestor Evan THOMAS of Hopewell)... 
              <br> One of the REESE <b>DNA MATCHES</b> looks to be to a descendant of Rev David Tasker REESE (1708-1787), previously not known to be actually of this family. 
              Capt James Polk REESE (b. 1744 Cecil Co MD d. 1828 Maury Co TN) of the old THOMAS neighborhood in Maury Co was a son. James Polk REESE buried at REESE Chapel along with his
              (Brevard) "kinsman" Isaac Jetton THOMAS (1781-1844) whose 1823 Federal style house "Montrose" is nearby. Additional notable son of cousin Isaac J. THOMAS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Addison_Thomas. 
          It seems possible that the REESE line is the most influential genetically on great grandfather James CLARK?</h4>
