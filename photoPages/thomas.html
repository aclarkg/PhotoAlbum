This match also claims descent from David REESE (ca 1655-1706), associate of probable ancestor Evan THOMAS of Llanycefn Wales. Also Ephraim LEITH (1725-86) of 
Bentonville VA area (associate of Capt Wm THOMAS) on her tree... Makes the daughter of Andrew JOB the likely mother of JOB THOMAS (b. 1730) of Royal Oaks Plantation VA...
