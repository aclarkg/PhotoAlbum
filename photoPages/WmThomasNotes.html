Assoc *(1) in south central Maury Co. ('was best neighborhood in TN') of 5 ?POSSIBLE Thomas family related lines:
<br><br>
1)Job H. (Howell) Thomas (b. 1780, Job H. was son of Jesse & Mary Howell Thomas, CUMBERLAND CO VA LINE, Royal Oaks Plantation - desc from JOB THOMAS b. ca 1730 Lancaster Co. PA, m. Hoggatt *(21) ca. 1753 ?Goochland Co VA, longhunter ca. 1746 in VA (?land grant on New River), 20 Blacks 1787 Cumb Co. VA).

<br><br>
2)Maybe Isaac J. Thomas (IREDELL CO. NC LINE - descended from JACOB THOMAS (b. ca 1727, origins in SE PA  Quaker Welsh Tract, Cecil Co MD (m. Brevard *(24) there 1753), Sussex Co Del, a John Thomas of Augusta Co. VA ca 1747 & NC, strong assoc with a Richard Lewis (?Welsh) (Source: 'Carolina Cradle' by Ramsey) ). Isaac J. and Job H. Thomas once exchanged custody of a child,  were listed consec on 1 list and lived in same neighborhood in southern Maury county. James Houston Thomas (law partner of Pres. James K. Polk & US & Confederate Congressman) was son of Isaac J. Another Jacob Thomas descendant (1st cousin once removed of James Houston Thomas) was David Thomas (1795-1836), signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence and lawyer ... Reese's Chapel next to Isaac J. Thomas 1823 Federal brick house S of Bigbyville, Maury Co TN named after James Polk Reese (b. 1739? Cecil Co MD, m. Eliz Brevard) - very possibly the same Rees family found in Chester Co PA/Cecil Co MD & assoc with Thomases in Hopewell, Frederick Co VA.
<br><br>
<br><br>
3} JOHN THOMAS *(7) (d. 1803 near Nashville, TN, ?m. 1762 Sarah Humphreys *(6) (b. ca 1737 Charlestown Twp Chester Co. PA d. TN, 3 bros moved Shenandoah valley VA, then 2 of them went to KY) at Christ Church Philadelphia. Members of the Robertson/Donelson Parties that founded Nashville, TN ca. 1780. 1787 Davidson Co. TN tax list - John Thomas + John, Wm. & Isaac Thomas listed together. Son 'Ensign' Joshua (b. abt. 1765 VA?, m. Nancy Overall of Overall, VA family - which may be important link between Capt Wm Thomas and John & Sarah Humphreys Thomas families) was killed Battle of Nickajack by Cherokees 1794, had other children who moved to S. Maury Co. (dau Sarah Thomas, 1774-1840, 'a noted beauty, a small woman with liquid eyes, black hair & brown eyes' m. Col Joseph Brown *(12), pioneer hero of Maury Co) ... Col G. W. Humphreys, nephew of Sarah Humphreys Thomas, was 1819 Vice Pres of African Colonization Society, Charles Town, Jefferson Co, VA.
<br><br>
A John Thomas of Loudoun Co assoc with Baptists Owen, David (sons of Rev. Owen Thomas I) & Rev. Joseph (son-in-law? of Rev. Owen Thomas I) Thomas & Wm Lewis (this name assoc with SE PA Welsh Quakers, became Baptists & slaveholders, moved Loudoun Co 1760's?).  Among the founders of this New Valley Baptist Church in Loudoun Co VA was Peter (m. Sarah) Thomas, maybe a desc of James II & Ann Warner Thomas. Migration of a John Thomas, Wm Lewis, etc... from Loudoun Co to ?Augusta?, then to Washington Co VA (staging area for Robertson/ Donelson Parties to TN) Another staging area for John & Sarah Humphreys Thomas may have been Washington Co TN since other families such as the Mathews, Leiths, Jobs, Humphreys were in that area ca ?1780 ... Other ?prob Thomas relations killed by Indians middle TN area - James & Eneas Thomas, after 1787.
<br><br>
<br><br>
4) A JOHN THOMAS assoc with Jacob (see above, m. Brevard), was in Augusta Co. VA about 1746. Colonel CALEB (Joshua) THOMAS (b. ca. 1774, moved Bedford Co VA ca. 1780?, Maury Co TN ca. 1807?, TN regiment 1812 Creek war) and son COLONEL JONAS ERWIN THOMAS (1802-1856; TN Regiment Mexican war, Maury Co. Sheriff, lawyer, 'most popular man in Maury Co.' abt. 1840; 3 slaves 1856 Will, sons Joshua, Reece, ...),  BEDFORD CO. VA LINE.  Bedford County became a refuge during the French & Indian War (late 1750's) from the upper Shen Valley (Augusta Co.), so was on the emigration path of the early settlers.
<br><br>
     Ca. 1808 or1818 Will of JOHN THOMAS, for tract of land in Bedford Co. VA, mentions sons Joshua (Colonel Caleb) Thomas & children of TN (Maury Co.), Isaac, Rufus (b. MD 1776), .... Also daughter Betsy m. to Samuel POTTS: Samuel Potts d. Hillsboro area?, Loudoun Co. VA 1801, m. Elizabeth Thomas. Father (Potts) was Welsh (Llangurig, Mongomeryshire origins) Quaker from Germantown (Phila.) PA; 1777, American Revolution campaign thru Lancaster, PA to battle at Germantown - CAPTAIN JOHN THOMAS & Lt Samuel Potts, with Company of Loudoun Co VA.
David POTTS Will 1768 Loudoun Co VA - g.d. Christina PEARSON ...
Evan Thomas (m. Ann?) 1757 Will, Loudoun Co VA - son in law executor Jonas POTTS (?Uncle of Lt. Samuel POTTS m. Eliz. Thomas); Will mentions Edward Mathew of PA, also Ben Burson (mother was Mary Rachel Potts, prob Aunt of Samuel (exec of Benjamin's 1769 Will?) & a ?sister of David & Jonas) & Sarah Burson as 'Quakers', children of Evan - David, James, Mary (m. Jonas POTTS). Evan possible son of DANIEL THOMAS II (Welsh Tract PA), son of Evan I & Mary Husband (her 2nd husband was Wm Howell bro of Margaret Howell Thomas) Thomas ...  Daniel & Evan Thomas lived near Abington & Cheltenham, Phila. (now Montg.) Co PA near Germantown where the POTTS originated.
<br><br>
Evan Thomas (d. 1757) may have been related to EVAN THOMAS *(23) d. 1755 Fred Co VA, m. Katherine, sons JOHN, eldest son Evan Jr, Thomas, Enos...) who was an early Quaker settler/Minister (ca 1733) to the Hopewell *(20) Mtg/Opequon Creek area (1,014 acres upper Turkey or 'Thomas' Run), NE of Winchester, Frederick Co VA, with leaders Alexander Ross (Scots-Irish, b. 1682 Inveresk Scot. - d. 1748) & Morgan Bryan (Welsh Quaker, lived NW of Bunker Hill Berkeley Co. VA, g dau Rebecca m. DANIEL BOONE), etc... from Nottingham Mtg, Chester Co PA/Cecil Co. MD. This Opequon Cr (e of PARKINS Mills?) area also home of John & Cath Leith in the ?1760's, ?bro of Ephraim Leith & possible parents of Cath ?Leith who ?m. Capt. Wm Thomas. Evan & ?Catherine's son JOHN THOMAS (ca 1710 - aft 1782, also lived Guilford Co NC, m. Else) was assoc of David Ross, son of Alexander, & Abel Walker in Fred. Co VA, desc of Lewis & Mary MORRIS Walker (b. Wales m. 1693 Haverford PA, James Thomas I & II & Wm Thomas attended), gparents of Joseph (m. Sarah Thomas) Walker of Many Springs Farm, Tredyffrin Twp, Chester Co PA. Evan Thomas Jr. *(27), bro of John, b. 1706 ?Cheltenham, Montg Co, PA, m. Albenah Ross dau of Alex.
<br><br>
Martha, dau of EVAN THOMAS of Hopewell, m. Henry REES *(26)  (Quakers from Llanddewi Wales, Chester Co PA/Cecil Co MD & White Hall, Fred. Co VA on "Morgan's Rd").
This assoc  might account for Capt. Wm Thomas naming a son REES - 1692 Haverford PA WEDDING of Thomas REES (? Henry's gfather, Gent. servant of EVAN of Llanycefn) & Rebecca Williams, wit JAMES THOMAS I & wife Marg HOWELL Thomas, Elinor Thomas (? wife of DANIEL THOMAS I), John Bevan, LEWIS THOMAS (?BRO of EVAN of LLANYCEFN, family ?moved Frederick Co VA), ...
<br><br>
EVAN (d. 1755) & Catherine THOMAS were wit at marriage of Watkin (son of Evan [?d. 1738 Easttown Twp PA] & Gwen Watkins Thomas) & Eliz Bevan (?dau of Wm who was bro of John Bevan) Thomas, 1728 Newtown, PA.
<br><br>
<br><br>
5) WILLIAM THOMAS, ?Woodford Co. KY - ?ca. 1790 had MILL (?G & S or MOSBY *(25) Mill?, 1861 atlas map) on Clear Cr south of Versailles, was CAPTAIN of KY militia; ?1795 - 10 blacks & 600 acres; was in VA (beautiful Shen valley) by at least 1773, moved KY bluegrass abt 1786-7 (Woodford Co.), then maybe Mercer County KY (with ?son Richard) abt. 1797, & then to Maury Co TN  abt. 1807. His clan seemed to have moved south from se PA 1730's-60's ... Woodford Co lawsuit May 1790: Thomas Blanton Vs Richard & Wm Thomas, defendants; attachment on dun horse & broadcloth for coat as payment to Blanton; ?helped build 1st jail in Versailles 1790... 4/1792, Woodford Co KY - Wm Thomas with 2 others to appraise slaves & personal estate of Thomas Bell, deceased ... Possible that he may have been the Wm Thomas (b. northern VA?) m. ca 1768 Catherine in Shen Co, now Warren Co sw of Front Royal on s branch near Bentonville *(11) VA, this may have been when he switched from Quaker to Presbyterian; served in the Am. Rev. from there as a Lt under Capt. John Netherton (1832 Pension Shelby Co KY), MILL builder, nickname of 'Honest Billy Thomas' in VA; had ?sons John, Richard, Samuel, William, Rees, etc ... (1792 Woodford Co KY Tax List - John, Richard, Samuel, Wm Thomas, etc ...). Capt Wm Thomas' father could have been Wm m. Eliz Thomas of Shen Co VA?, b. ca. 1730 Cecil Co MD?, making him possibly a desc of Evan Thomas. His ?(g) father could have been John, son of Evan & Cath Thomas of Hopewell, VA.
 From his strong assoc with the Scots-Irish ?Presbyterian Mathews & Leiths at Bentonville VA (founded 1749), Wm Thomas may have been Presbyterian for a time. The area these families are thought to come from in the Cecil Co MD/ south Chester/Lancaster Co PA region ('Susquehanna Manor/New Connacht', the 'Nottingham Lots') settled in the early 1700's most heavily by PA Quakers & Scots-Irish Presbyterians...Many Presbyterians were in Maury Co TN early 19th century to include the Polks, Col Jonas Erwin Thomas (allied with Scots-Irish Erwins & Crocketts, attended McCain's Presbyterian Church s of Columbia?) ...
Capt Wm Thomas looks most like he could be a desc of Evan & Cath Thomas of Hopewell, Frederick Co VA, & SE PA & Wales ...

***  <h1>MAIN HYPOTHESIS:</h1>  the 3 lines of Thomases (1- James m. Howell of Merion or 2- William of Newtown (moved there from Radnor 1698?) m. Pillips  or 3 - Daniel/Evan of Abington) in the Welsh Tract PA early 1700's named above, had desc accounting for the various (5) Thomas lines south of Columbia, TN in the early 19th century. 1 possible scenario is that Sarah Thomas Brown, wife of Colonel Joseph Brown, had connection to Capt Wm Thomas through the Overalls & his Thomas kin in TN & drew him to Maury Co. Then some of the other lines  were contacted by Wm? RESULT: ? 1 source says that the line of John & Sarah Humphreys Thomas was desc from Wm & Eliz Philips Thomas of Welsh Tract PA (? desc from Thomas of Llanbradach) ... see FINAL SUMMARY  Marine D THOMAS notes ***
<br><br>
 It looks as if the 2 lines of Col Jonas E Thomas & Capt Wm Thomas may have been desc from Daniel & Evan Thomas of Abington, PA since Jonas' Aunt m. a Potts in Loudoun Co VA, etc ... I am leaning to the Job & especially the Jacob lines more distantly related, perhaps from either Wm & Eliz Thomas or James Thomas I or even Evan Thomas.
<br><br>
And it appears possible from the pedigree that Rees THOMAS (m. Martha Aubrey) was a great grandson of generation 18 of the Squires OF LLANBRADACH, William Thomas (d. 1654, m. Joan LLEWELYN of Rydlafar) by his son Rees. Eliz Thomas (m. Wm Aubrey of Pencoed) was the dau of Thomas Thomas (d. 1667, m. Dorothy, dau of Sir John Carew of Camerton, Co Somerset), gen 19 Squire of Llanbradach. That would make her daughter, Barbara Aubrey (m. John Bevan, Quaker leader of Glamorgan, Wales & PA) maybe the 2nd cousin of Rees Thomas (m. Martha Aubrey), a contemporary. Also, Rees seems to have come to PA ca 1691 with his brothers & a number of his paternal cousins to the ?2nd degree as Welsh Quakers, among whom may have been Wm Thomas (m. Eliz Phillips whose father attended wedding of Reese & Martha), & Daniel/Evan Thomas, prob close cousins to Rees Thomas ...  Aside from Rees & his 2 ?brothers, the other Thomas lines (James, Wm m. Philips, Evan/Daniel) could be possibly desc from 1 of the Thomas, Wm, Richd or Lewis THOMASes on Thomas of Llanbradach pedigree (Rees & Lewis 1st names on every Gen. 15 thru 18) since these names found in their families.
