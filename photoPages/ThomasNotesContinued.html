Family sources & DNA TEST show that Jacob THOMAS (b. ca 1725 MD? d. NC 1788, m. Brevard, ancestor of Isaac J. & James Houston THOMAS) was of WELSH origin. Speculated descent 
    from JOHN THOMAS, son of Evan THOMAS of Hopewell VA, with definite origins in Quaker Welsh Tract, Phila PA. Located at junction of Buffalo Shoals Cr & Catawba River SW of Statesville, Iredell Co NC 18th cent.
<br><br>
Descent of Ralph, Wm (of Eglwysilan/PA) & David (Lewis David of Llanddewi/PA) LEWIS: A memorandum, dated ... 1899, signed by Thomas Allen Glenn ...  [states they were] son[s] of Ralph Lewis of Llanishen, a landholder in Eglwysilan in 1683 (died), who married Ann Prichard (of Collenna); that Ralph Lewis was the son of David Lewis, landholder in Eglwysilan, who died in 1630; that David Lewis was son of Edward Lewis of Llanishen (m. ca 1602 Margaret Gwyn of Llanishen, paternally descended  from a branch of THOMAS of Llanbradach), who was the son of Edward Lewis [Esquire of Van], a large landholder in Eglwysilan & Sheriff of Glamorganshire in 1548. This Edward Lewis married Ann, daughter of [Sir] Wm MORGAN of Pencoed, and was the son of Lewis ap Richard Gwyn. Wm Lewis of Eglwysilan/PA used seal on his 1707 will of Bleddyn ap Maenarch coat of arms.
<br>    
Also, a will:

Proved 19 Sep 1669
Inventory was overseen by Edward PRICHARD & William Edward.
This seems to be a Wm LEWIS of Eglwysilan related (cousin, uncle?) to the Quaker LEWIS bros who moved to PA. Note MARY WILLIAM prob the same as in 1684 letter of Wm LEWIS. A related Lewis was prob LEWIS of Glyn Taff Eglwysilan, descended from Wm LEWIS, 2nd son of Edward LEWIS, Esq. of Van, Sheriff 1548. It still seems most likely the 3 Quaker LEWIS brothers of PA were sons of Ralph LEWIS of Llanishen/Eglwysilan d. 1683.
<br><br>
?Thought that THOMAS of Llanbradach could have branched from a son of MORGAN of Tredegar ca 1400 - 1st names David, Jevan, Llewelyn, Philip in common, THOMAS marriage with MORGAN...
<br><br>
<b>?Speculated descent from Wm THOMAS Esquire of Llanbradach (Gen. XVIII) who m. Joan Llewelyn ca 1600: Richard Thomas m. Jane Lewis, Thomas Thomas m. Bowen, Evan Thomas m. 1678 Mary Husband, Evan Thomas of Hopewell VA m. ca 1705 a MORRIS (proven by DNA MATCH) and m. (2) 1713 Katherine Evans of Aberhafesp Wales, John Thomas m. JOB, Wm Thomas Sr m. Eliz Reese, Capt Wm Thomas m. Duvall, Marine Duvall Thomas m. 1826 Jane Pullen, Nancy Ann Thomas (d. 1912) m. Jonathan Clark... (10 generations)...
    Also Gen XVII JOHN THOMAS of Llanbradach, Esquire, m. ca 1575 Mary MORGAN * of Bedwelty & Penllwyn Sarth (branch of MORGAN of Tredegar).</b>
<br><br>
! Note that Evan THOMAS of Hopewell VA (m. Katherine Evans of Aberhafesp Wales) seems almost certainly the younger son of Evan THOMAS of Llanycefn: because his grand daughter, Catherine REESE Branson (daughter of HENRY and Martha THOMAS REESE), inherited his house ca 1771 or 81? ** & was the great grand daughter of Thomas REESE, son of David REESE who attended Evan THOMAS of Llanycefn's wedding 1678, & 1682 young gentleman servant of Evan THOMAS of Llanycefn. Any activities in Britain (Dolobran Wales, etc...) are open to question...
    Aberhafesp W of Newtown, Montgomeryshire Wales. Area old gentry families include Morgan of Aberhafesp, Evans of Kerry & Evans of Dolfor.
<br><br>
?Possible location of LEWIS DAVID Wales estate 1600's: Trewern, Llanddewi Velfre parish, Pembroke Wales, about 1/2 way between Whitland & Llanddewi Velfre village & a little north near River Taf. Site now occupied by "fine large early C19 house", Trewern [Fawr] Mansion,  owned 1840 by John Beynon, Esquire.
<br><br>
Interesting story of long running feud between maternal ancestors of MORGAN of Tredegar, the princely "Welsh lords of Caerleon", & the noble Norman de Clare family: on 15 April 1136 N of Abergavenny Wales, Morgan of Caerleon with others killed Richard de Clare, who was accompanied by a minstrel & singer, at mountain pass Coed Grono near  Llanthony Abbey...From Itinerary Through Wales by Giraldus Cambrensis.
<br><br>
Possible (probable?) descendant of Lewis THOMAS, brother of Evan THOMAS of Llanycefn Wales: Maj. Gen. John Franklin THOMAS (b. 1763 Frederick Co VA - 1838, son of Owen b. 1736 (of Washington Co KY); m. dau of Robert Hodgen namesake of Hodgenville KY, wealthy leader and MILLwright), Captain in Rev. Army, Brig. General in War of 1812 (KY). "OWEN THOMAS (b. 1736) was the son of LEWIS THOMAS and his wife, JANE. Frederick County, Virginia, Will Book 1, page 454: May 16, 1751 - 'Bond in the amount of 100 pounds current money is given by John SMITH as administrator of the estate of LEWIS THOMAS, deceased, with Samuel WALKER and OWEN THOMAS as securities. JANE THOMAS, the widow, and OWEN THOMAS, the heir at law... Since OWEN THOMAS was named 'heir at law,' it can be assumed that he was the eldest son of LEWIS and JANE. Though other children are not named, we know LEWIS had at least one brother. Since LEWIS' estate was not finally settled until 1756, we may assume that then the youngest child became of age. ..The earliest record of LEWIS THOMAS in Virginia is in Orange County order Book 1, page 57. LEWIS was living in that part of Orange County which became FREDERICK County in 1743 at which time mention of him ceases in Orange County and begins in the new Frederick County. To judge by the given names [ENOS, etc...], the THOMASes living as neighbors in Frederick County were probably related. Many early arriving THOMASes, and for that matter, many Welsh immigrants, were Quakers and often were found living in strictly Quaker communities, some in Pennsylvania, one in the Elk River area of Maryland. EVAN THOMAS, who died in Frederick County in 1755, was a prominent Quaker..."

    <br> <br> 
2nd wife of Capt Wm THOMAS, ?Unknown Duvall (?b. MD ca 1775), was ?probably an undocumented daughter of Cornelius and Keziah Duvall Duvall of Scott Co KY. 
    These 2 were cousins, descendants of the original French Huguenot Mareen Duvall (ca 1625-1694), and both of their fathers were named Mareen Duvall. Son of Capt Wm THOMAS was ancestor Marine Duvall THOMAS b. KY 1802.

    <br> <br>
After studying the Battle of Shiloh, it seems most likely? that maternal cousin Capt Joseph E. Emerson was mortally wounded about ?afternoon Sun April 6, 1862 in fighting at the "Hornets Nest" 
    with Co E of the 3rd KY CSA. He died the next day, Monday, maybe about 2 PM next to Shiloh Church. Also with the Kentucky Confederates at Shiloh

Young BARLOW & DUVAL ate plentifully of the green apples with a generous amount of old Monongahela & got quite sick." 
The DUVAL that accompanied Daniel  BOONE & his son Nathan Bonne (15 slaves 1850 Greene Co MO) was very likely Mareen <b>DUVALL</b> (ca 1775-1844), son of Cornelius & Keziah DUVALL of Scott Co KY & ?brother of 4th g grandmother ?

Possibility that the Quaker REESE family associated with the THOMASes could be descended from Reese Ap John, of Mydvai or Morthvey,
    county Carmarthen Wales, who himself descended from the Meddygon Mydavi (legendary "Physicians of Myddfai"), who owned estates there in the year 1220 AD.   
        <br> <br>
William N. THOMAS, a son of 4th g grandfather Capt William THOMAS, married 1801 Frances Vaught. Frances was b. Gooney Run Shenandoah Co VA (now Warren Co), d. Rutherford Co TN near Milton.
    It ?appears she was the aunt of Nathan Vaught (b. 1799 Shenandoah Co VA, moved 1804 Rutherford Co TN, d. Maury Co TN 1880), "Master Builder of Maury Co TN". He built the fine antebellum southern mansions of 
    Clifton Place, Elm Springs (now headquarters of Sons of Confederate Veterans), Walnut Grove, Pillow Place, etc... in Maury Co.

    THOMAS, of Maury Co TN) were cousins. Lt Samuel Potts was 1st cousin to father of Billy Potts (or nearly related), ca 1820 alleged river pirate of the Ohio River, S IL, with "Potts Hill Gang"?

Probable Ancestor: Dame Jenet MATHEW, wife of Sir Rhys ap Thomas, through her 1st husband Thomas STRADLING of St Donats Castle Glamorgan. 
His grandfather was Sir Edward Stradling who married a daughter of Henry VI's great uncle Cardinal Beaufort. Sir Edward's son was 
Sir Harry Stradling who was held ransom by the Breton pirate Colyn Dolphyn in 1449. Jenet's granddaughter was Elizabeth STRADLING who m. Edmond MORGAN 
    of Penyllwyn Sarth/Bedwelty and was mother to Mary MORGAN, grandmother of ancestor Richard THOMAS of Llanbradach/Pembroke. <br> 
    The Welsh gentry were highly intermarried over hundreds of years, and there could be over a ?million ancestors 20 generations ago ca 1500 (https://blog.eogn.com/2018/01/26/how-many-ancestors-do-you-have/). 
<strong> *** <i>Note </strong>that the Welsh Quakers of Pennsylvania with surname THOMAS, descended from THOMAS of Llanbradach as documented by Rees THOMAS (m. Aubrey), 
look to be the only possible family to be ancestors of 4 of the associated THOMAS families of southern Maury Co TN in early 19th century (see detailed genealogy, Rootsweb).</i><b> *** </b> <br>
Source: Limbus Patrum... G.T. Clark.       
<br> <br>    
The pedigree of THOMAS of Llanbradach in Limbus Patrum by G.T. Clark (p. 31) is ?probably fictitious prior to about Gen. XII in the early 1400's. 
Perhaps a better, alternative origin, would possibly be as a branch of MORGAN of Tredegar (p. 310). Namely, DAVID ap Jevan (Gen. XI ca. 1415-48) ap Llewelyn ap MORGAN. 
He could correspond to DAVID ap Jevan of Llanbradach (Gen. XII) who m. Maud dau of MORGAN ap Llewelyn of Tredegar. Both families also had 
common ties to Lewis of Rhiwperra (p.34).

    <b>Quakers: Pryse / Pryce / Price family: Glan Towy, Cilgwyn, Dugoedydd, Ystradffin, Mandinam</b>
    <br>
The following establishes a connection between the Pryse / Pryce / Price familes of: Glan Towy, Cilgwyn and Ystradffin which was not previously in the public domain:
    <br>
 <b>The Lort muniments</b> (Schedule of the Lort Muniments, County Record Office, Carmarthenshire (now removed) https://archive.org/details/casLort) 1660 indicate that 
    <b>Richard Price ["of Killycomb (Cilycwm), Gentleman"]</b> (of Cwm Dynant - Wooding notes) took over the <b>lease on the Ystradffin estate</b> and was at the time accompanied by his two sons Edward and Rowland, both minors.
 Rowland Price of Dugoedydd in his will (Will of Rowland Pryse. NLW, Neuadd-fawr Estate Records, file 334) also refers to his brother Edward Price and his cousin Rees Price of Glan Towy.
 Edward price (of Ystradffin) was High Sheriff of Cardiganshire in 1724 (The London Gazette No. 6231. Sheriff appointments for 1724 https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/6231/page/1    &   
https://archive.org/details/listofsheriffsfo00newy/page/n3/mode/2up  page 243 ).
 Edward's daughter Mary (of Ystradffin / Mandinam) in her will (Will of Mary Lloyd https://en.powys.gov.uk/media/1114/R_D_LEW_01_bi/pdf/R_D_LEW_01_bi.pdf?m=1513612802243 ) refers to her uncle Rowland of Dugoedydd and her kinsman Rees Price of Glan Towy Attorney at Law.\
 Daniel B James, in his book Myddfai its Lands and Peoples, describes this cousin Rees and his father James in relation to Glan Towy as:


 The first person to have lived there is <b>James Price who is described in the 1684 return as a ‘giddy brained Quaker</b> and a rail rag to the church. It is further recorded that he did not attend church.’ He is buried at what was the Quaker grave-garden in Llandovery. His son Rees Price was an attorney who also lived at Glan Towy and owned a number of properties; it was he who purchased Cilgwyn Manor Myddfai where his son James Price resided.


 The will of James Price Quaker (Will of James Price. NLW, SD/1709/178 https://journals.library.wales/browse/1380216/ ) also refers to his cousin Rowland Price of Digoedith. The Quaker burial record for Llandovery indicates James Price was buried there in 1709.


 Together with the following reference ( Bidgood, R., The Prices of Abergwenlais, Bwlch Tribann(n)au and Erryd, Cilycwm: A North Carmarthenshire Kinship network, The Carmarthenshire Antiquary, 2018, pp. 51-64, Vol. 43, 2007 ) it is possible to construct the following pedigree:

<br> <br>
 ? Price [From Lort Records: <b>1659</b> May 24 

RECEIPT of William Gwynne of Talliarys, esquire, to <b>Roger Lort 
of Stakkpoolle Court [Pembrokeshire], esquire</b>, ...
    Witnesses: /"<b>James?} Prices</b>; John Griffith; <b>Rees Price ["gentleman"</b> in 1662 record] (This could be the father of James PRICE & ancestor David PRICE/<b>(ap)</b> REES; their father appears

<b>Richard Price</b>. [Roger Lort bought Ystradffin 1651.]<br>
Best guess so far for the origins of the PRICE family, from https://doczz.net/doc/2180405/medieval-welsh-settlement-and-territory "...held the lease ...
mill along with the grange, divers messuages, lands and
tenancies in the parishes of Llanwenog and Llandysul [Cardigan],

Llywelyn Lloyd in <b>1579</b>." This would be the Thomas WILLIAM of Ystradffin (m. Joan PRICE) & his brother-in-law <b>RICHARD PRICE of Brecon</b>, seeming to indicate a business 
    relationship. Coud be a link from their father <b>Sir John PRICE of Brecon</b> to <b>RICHARD PRICE & ancestor REES PRICE</b> of Cilycwm/Ystradffin area? That there would be 
    2 RICHARD PRICES associated with Ystradffin from different families of the same type seems highly unlikely... From Price of Abergwenlais (Cilycwm) page: "According to

Found matches from <b>DNA test</b> to line of <b>Jacob THOMAS</b> (m. Brevard, Welsh Quaker?, of PA and NC), ancestor of James Houston THOMAS (law partner of President James K Polk Columbia TN 1843). 
May confirm original hypothesis that James Houston THOMAS and his father Isaac Jetton THOMAS (a son of Ensign John THOMAS) were both neighbors and cousins in southern Maury Co TN early 1800's to 4th g grandfather Capt Wm THOMAS. 
There is probability that Jacob (b. ca 1727) was a son of John THOMAS of Hopewell VA, son of Evan, and ?therefore brother of Job THOMAS of Royal Oaks Plantation VA and Wm I (?father of Capt Wm THOMAS). Jacob was documented (see Carolina Cradle)
in both Cecil Co MD and the northern Shenandoah Valley VA (with a relative named John THOMAS) ca 1750, the migration path of Evan THOMAS. Jacob also thought to have origins in the Philadelphia PA area and/or Delaware, and descendants have Welsh Y-DNA. Alternatively, could be 
a descendant of James THOMAS of Merion PA and Llanboidy Wales, a probable descendant of THOMAS of Llanbradach Wales. In either case they are all probably paternal blood kin...

    THOMAS & ?William THOMAS... Note that there are 2 maternal THOMAS lines (Clark-THOMAS & Garrett-THOMAS), <b>probably not</b> related but causing some

    & Mary Amelia THOMAS, daughter of John & Sarah Humphreys THOMAS & sister of Sarah THOMAS Brown, so DNA match might be from either or both THOMAS lines: could also be descendants
