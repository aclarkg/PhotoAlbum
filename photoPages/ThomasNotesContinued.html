[states they were] son[s] of Ralph Lewis of Llanishen, a landholder in Eglwysilan in 1683 (died), who married Ann Prichard (of Collenna); that Ralph Lewis was the son of David Lewis, landholder in Eglwysilan, who died in 1630; that David Lewis was son of Edward Lewis of Llanishen (m. ca 1602 Margaret Gwyn of Llanishen, paternally descended  from a branch of THOMAS of Llanbradach), who was the son of Edward Lewis [Esquire of Van], a large landholder in Eglwysilan & Sheriff of Glamorganshire in 1548. This Edward Lewis married Ann, daughter of [Sir] Wm MORGAN of Pencoed, and was the son of Lewis ap Richard Gwyn.

Inventory was overseen by Edward PRICHARD & William Edward.
This seems to be a Wm LEWIS of Eglwysilan related (cousin, uncle?) to the Quaker LEWIS bros who moved to PA. Note MARY WILLIAM prob the same as in 1684 letter of Wm LEWIS. A related Lewis was prob LEWIS of Glyn Taff Eglwysilan, descended from Wm LEWIS, 2nd son of Edward LEWIS, Esq. of Van, Sheriff 1548. It still seems most likely the 3 Quaker LEWIS brothers of PA were sons of Ralph LEWIS of Llanishen/Eglwysilan d. 1683.
