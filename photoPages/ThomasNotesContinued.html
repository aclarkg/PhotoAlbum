Family sources & DNA TEST show that Jacob THOMAS (b. ca 1725 MD? d. NC 1788, m. Brevard, ancestor of Isaac J. & James Houston THOMAS) was of WELSH origin. Speculated descent from JAMES THOMAS of Llanboidy/Merion with definite origins in Quaker Welsh Tract, Phila PA. Located at junction of Buffalo Shoals Cr & Catawba River SW of Statesville, Iredell Co NC 18th cent.

Descent of Ralph, Wm (of Eglwysilan/PA) & David (Lewis David of Llanddewi/PA) LEWIS: A memorandum, dated ... 1899, signed by Thomas Allen Glenn ...  [states they were] son[s] of Ralph Lewis of Llanishen, a landholder in Eglwysilan in 1683 (died), who married Ann Prichard (of Collenna); that Ralph Lewis was the son of David Lewis, landholder in Eglwysilan, who died in 1630; that David Lewis was son of Edward Lewis of Llanishen (m. ca 1602 Margaret Gwyn of Llanishen, paternally descended  from a branch of THOMAS of Llanbradach), who was the son of Edward Lewis [Esquire of Van], a large landholder in Eglwysilan & Sheriff of Glamorganshire in 1548. This Edward Lewis married Ann, daughter of [Sir] Wm MORGAN of Pencoed, and was the son of Lewis ap Richard Gwyn. Wm Lewis of Eglwysilan/PA used seal on his 1707 will similar to LEWIS of Llanishen coat of arms.
Also, a will:

Proved 19 Sep 1669
Inventory was overseen by Edward PRICHARD & William Edward.
This seems to be a Wm LEWIS of Eglwysilan related (cousin, uncle?) to the Quaker LEWIS bros who moved to PA. Note MARY WILLIAM prob the same as in 1684 letter of Wm LEWIS. A related Lewis was prob LEWIS of Glyn Taff Eglwysilan, descended from Wm LEWIS, 2nd son of Edward LEWIS, Esq. of Van, Sheriff 1548. It still seems most likely the 3 Quaker LEWIS brothers of PA were sons of Ralph LEWIS of Llanishen/Eglwysilan d. 1683.

?Thought that THOMAS of Llanbradach could have branched from a son of MORGAN of Tredegar ca 1400 - 1st names David, Jevan, Llewelyn, Philip in common, THOMAS marriage with MORGAN...

?Speculated descent from Wm THOMAS Esquire of Llanbradach (Gen. XVIII) who m. Joan Llewelyn ca 1600: Richard Thomas m. Jane Lewis, Thomas Thomas m. Bowen, Evan Thomas m. 1678 Mary Husband, Evan Thomas m. Catherine Morris, John Thomas m. Job or Hiatt, Wm Thomas Sr m. Eliz Reese, Capt Wm Thomas m. Duvall, Marine Duvall Thomas m. 1826 Jane Pullen, Nancy Ann Thomas (d. 1912) m. Jonathan Clark... (10 generations).

Location of LEWIS DAVID Wales estate 1600's: Trewern, Llanddewi Velfre parish, Pembroke Wales, about 1/2 way between Whitland & Llanddewi Velfre village & a little north near River Taf. Site now occupied by "fine large early C19 house", Trewern [Fawr] Mansion,  owned 1840 by John Beynon, Esquire.

Interesting story of long running feud between maternal ancestors of MORGAN of Tredegar, the princely "Welsh lords of Caerleon", & the noble Norman de Clare family: in 1135 N of Abergavenny Wales, Morgan of Caerleon killed Richard de Clare, who was accompanied by a minstrel & singer, at mountain pass Coed Grono...From Itinerary Through Wales by Giraldus Cambrensis.

* NE Wales Border = old South Rheged territory of Brittonic Celts NE of Liverpool (Lancashire). DNA indicates that the maternal THOMAS lines may have lived not only in what is now modern Wales in very olden times, but also the areas of Cornwall & Lancashire (South Rheged, "the Old North" of the Britons). Last King of South Rheged d. 634 (Llywarch Hen). This fits on presumed ancestral THOMAS/REES line: grandson of Sir Rhys ap Thomas (aka Sir REES ap Thomas) claimed ancestry from Urien Rheged, King of North Rheged d. 586, & Welsh folk hero from poems by Taliesin (fl 6th cent CE) who sang in the courts of Powys & Rheged. For this, claiming Kingship of Wales, he was executed by Henry VIII. " Rhys ap Griffith (1508-1531), who was later executed by Henry VIII ... as he was considered a threat to Henry VIII and was executed for treason ... (purportedly for inscribing the name 'Fitz Uryan' on his armor)." ... Some historians think the son (Llywarch Hen) of the brother (Elidir Lydanwyn="the stout & handsome") of Urien Rheged's father (Cynfarch Oer) became ruler of south Rheged & later moved down into Powys Wales. This could have been part of the REES's ancestry. LlYWARCH HEN (descended from Coel Hen aka Old King Cole, fl. early 5th cent?) was an ancestor of RHODRI MAWR. Therefore, THOMAS of Llanbradach, REES, LEWIS of Van, MORGAN of Tredegar, ?all descendants of the family of the LORD RHYS, were descendants of Rhodri Mawr & the family of URIEN RHEGED.

**  Although tradition says the GARRETTs came to America from Leicestershire, the DNA indicates either SE England (more likely? since it has highest DNA % at 36.1 %) near London or Yorkshire as their main origin, which coincides with Forebears website of the places with greatest incidence of the surname in England.

*** 1 source says the WILCOXes orginated in the Bristol, England area, which coincides with Forebears website of 1 of the places with greatest incidence of the surname in England (Gloucestershire). However, less DNA shows up from here. Other counties that are possibilities are Yorkshire & Lincolnshire, which have higher DNA & high incidence of the surname. Red hair has highest incidence towards Scotland (13 % of population).

* (4) It is possible some of the E Anglia/SE England DNA could have been the Dutch GULICK  or German CURTNER, etc...

* (5) Possibilities for the North of England DNA include HALL, ... Other DNA - paternal Quaker COPPOCKS (Saxon?) of (Aaron) Mobberly, Cheshire England & (Joseph) 1677 Quaker Meeting at Franley Lancashire, probably part of NE Wales Borders (NW England) %. BYRDs also had ancestral roots in Cheshire, though they moved to London.
