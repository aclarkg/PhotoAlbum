<br><br>
Family sources & DNA TEST show that Jacob THOMAS (b. ca 1725 MD? d. NC 1788, m. Brevard, ancestor of Isaac J. & James Houston THOMAS) was of WELSH origin. Speculated descent from JAMES THOMAS of Llanboidy/Merion with definite origins in Quaker Welsh Tract, Phila PA. Located at junction of Buffalo Shoals Cr & Catawba River SW of Statesville, Iredell Co NC 18th cent.
<br><br>
Descent of Ralph, Wm (of Eglwysilan/PA) & David (Lewis David of Llanddewi/PA) LEWIS: A memorandum, dated ... 1899, signed by Thomas Allen Glenn ...  [states they were] son[s] of Ralph Lewis of Llanishen, a landholder in Eglwysilan in 1683 (died), who married Ann Prichard (of Collenna); that Ralph Lewis was the son of David Lewis, landholder in Eglwysilan, who died in 1630; that David Lewis was son of Edward Lewis of Llanishen (m. ca 1602 Margaret Gwyn of Llanishen, paternally descended  from a branch of THOMAS of Llanbradach), who was the son of Edward Lewis [Esquire of Van], a large landholder in Eglwysilan & Sheriff of Glamorganshire in 1548. This Edward Lewis married Ann, daughter of [Sir] Wm MORGAN of Pencoed, and was the son of Lewis ap Richard Gwyn. Wm Lewis of Eglwysilan/PA used seal on his 1707 will of Bleddyn ap Maenarch coat of arms.
<br>    
Also, a will:

Proved 19 Sep 1669
Inventory was overseen by Edward PRICHARD & William Edward.
This seems to be a Wm LEWIS of Eglwysilan related (cousin, uncle?) to the Quaker LEWIS bros who moved to PA. Note MARY WILLIAM prob the same as in 1684 letter of Wm LEWIS. A related Lewis was prob LEWIS of Glyn Taff Eglwysilan, descended from Wm LEWIS, 2nd son of Edward LEWIS, Esq. of Van, Sheriff 1548. It still seems most likely the 3 Quaker LEWIS brothers of PA were sons of Ralph LEWIS of Llanishen/Eglwysilan d. 1683.
<br><br>
?Thought that THOMAS of Llanbradach could have branched from a son of MORGAN of Tredegar ca 1400 - 1st names David, Jevan, Llewelyn, Philip in common, THOMAS marriage with MORGAN...
<br><br>
?Speculated descent from Wm THOMAS Esquire of Llanbradach (Gen. XVIII) who m. Joan Llewelyn ca 1600: Richard Thomas m. Jane Lewis, Thomas Thomas m. Bowen, Evan Thomas m. 1678 Mary Husband, Evan Thomas of Hopewell VA m. ca 1705 a MORRIS (proven by DNA MATCH) and m. (2) 1713 Katherine Evans of Aberhafesp Wales, John Thomas m. JOB, Wm Thomas Sr m. Eliz Reese, Capt Wm Thomas m. Duvall, Marine Duvall Thomas m. 1826 Jane Pullen, Nancy Ann Thomas (d. 1912) m. Jonathan Clark... (10 generations)...
    Also Gen XVII JOHN THOMAS of Llanbradach, Esquire, m. ca 1575 Mary MORGAN * of Bedwelty & Penllwyn Sarth (branch of MORGAN of Tredegar).
<br><br>
! Note that Evan THOMAS of Hopewell VA (m. Katherine Evans of Aberhafesp Wales) seems almost certainly the younger son of Evan THOMAS of Llanycefn: because his grand daughter, Catherine REESE Branson (daughter of HENRY and Martha THOMAS REESE), inherited his house ca 1771 or 81? ** & was the great grand daughter of Thomas REESE, son of David REESE who attended Evan THOMAS of Llanycefn's wedding 1678, & 1682 young gentleman servant of Evan THOMAS of Llanycefn. Any activities in Britain (Dolobran Wales, etc...) are open to question...
    Aberhafesp W of Newtown, Montgomeryshire Wales. Area old gentry families include Morgan of Aberhafesp, Evans of Kerry & Evans of Dolfor.
<br><br>
?Possible location of LEWIS DAVID Wales estate 1600's: Trewern, Llanddewi Velfre parish, Pembroke Wales, about 1/2 way between Whitland & Llanddewi Velfre village & a little north near River Taf. Site now occupied by "fine large early C19 house", Trewern [Fawr] Mansion,  owned 1840 by John Beynon, Esquire.
<br><br>
Interesting story of long running feud between maternal ancestors of MORGAN of Tredegar, the princely "Welsh lords of Caerleon", & the noble Norman de Clare family: on 15 April 1136 N of Abergavenny Wales, Morgan of Caerleon with others killed Richard de Clare, who was accompanied by a minstrel & singer, at mountain pass Coed Grono near  Llanthony Abbey...From Itinerary Through Wales by Giraldus Cambrensis.
<br><br>
Possible (probable?) descendant of Lewis THOMAS, brother of Evan THOMAS of Llanycefn Wales: Maj. Gen. John Franklin THOMAS (b. 1763 Frederick Co VA - 1838, son of Owen b. 1736 (of Washington Co KY); m. dau of Robert Hodgen namesake of Hodgenville KY, wealthy leader and MILLwright), Captain in Rev. Army, Brig. General in War of 1812 (KY). "OWEN THOMAS (b. 1736) was the son of LEWIS THOMAS and his wife, JANE. Frederick County, Virginia, Will Book 1, page 454: May 16, 1751 - 'Bond in the amount of 100 pounds current money is given by John SMITH as administrator of the estate of LEWIS THOMAS, deceased, with Samuel WALKER and OWEN THOMAS as securities. JANE THOMAS, the widow, and OWEN THOMAS, the heir at law... Since OWEN THOMAS was named 'heir at law,' it can be assumed that he was the eldest son of LEWIS and JANE. Though other children are not named, we know LEWIS had at least one brother. Since LEWIS' estate was not finally settled until 1756, we may assume that then the youngest child became of age. ..The earliest record of LEWIS THOMAS in Virginia is in Orange County order Book 1, page 57. LEWIS was living in that part of Orange County which became FREDERICK County in 1743 at which time mention of him ceases in Orange County and begins in the new Frederick County. To judge by the given names [ENOS, etc...], the THOMASes living as neighbors in Frederick County were probably related. Many early arriving THOMASes, and for that matter, many Welsh immigrants, were Quakers and often were found living in strictly Quaker communities, some in Pennsylvania, one in the Elk River area of Maryland. EVAN THOMAS, who died in Frederick County in 1755, was a prominent Quaker..."

  <br> <br>   
!From Deep River Guilford Co NC Quaker MM Minboazutes: JOHN THOMAS departed this life 1781 (identified as son of Evan THOMAS of Hopewell VA) next to Philip Hoggatt (Uncle of Eliz Hoggatt who m. Job THOMAS of Royal Oaks Plantation VA) d. 1783 about age 96.
      <br> <br> 
Concerning ?education of Evan THOMAS of Hopewell VA in Britain: associate Charles Lloyd (1662–1747) of Dolobran had 2 paternal uncles and his father that attended Jesus College Oxford. From 'The House of Commons, 1690-1715': 
    only 17 per cent of members admitted to Oxford or Cambridge graduated. The mother of Charles Lloyd was Elizabeth Lort (1633–1685), 
    daughter of Sampson Lort (m. a daughter of Sir John Philipps of Picton Castle) of East Moor near Manorbier in PEMBROKESHIRE, 
    1 of the 3 sons of Henry Lort of Stackpole Court in  PEMBROKESHIRE, Sheriff of  PEMBROKESHIRE in 1619,
    of whom the eldest was Sir Roger Lort, 1st Baronet 1662. Charles and Sarah (Crowley) Lloyd witnessed (at top of list) 1718 removal of Evan and Katherine THOMAS from Dolobran Wales Quaker Mtg along with 17 other names.
    <br> <br> 
Emily Caroline Jackson (b. Graves Co KY 1855 d. 1929, buried E of Fulton KY Boaz Chapel), daughter of John T. Jackson and Mary E. THOMAS (sister of 2nd great grandmother Nancy Ann THOMAS Clark), 
    and orphan living with uncle Francis Marion THOMAS 1870 and 1880 Weakley Co TN, m. John Shadrach "Shade" Meacham (1845-1926, eldest child). John was Private Co C 
    12th KY Cav CSA. His father Joseph George Meacham (1822-23 JUN 1862, of Graves Co KY 1860) served in Co A 7th KY Mtd Inf CSA, died Confederate Hospital Marion, Lauderdale Co MS and
    married Susan Boaz (daughter of Shadrach Boaz). Susan's paternal uncle was Joshua Boaz (9 slaves Graves Co KY 1850). Epitaph of 
    Shade written by his son Wayne: "... Confederate soldier ... served under General Forrest... In memory...". Captain of Co C 12th KY Cav CSA 
    was G.W. Clanton, gg grandfather of singer Pat Boone, his 1st Lt was William Rutherford Boaz (an eldest son, brother of Susan *** and 
    later Captain). Epitaph of Emily: "Loved one at rest"... In 1860 Emily lived with her parents and 2 siblings in NE Arkansas (moved from KY ca 1859) ...
    She married Feb 1884 Obion Co TN, had 4 children and lived 1920 near Water Valley KY... Father of (Major/Captain) G.W. Clanton, John W. Clanton 17 slaves Graves co KY 1850 ...
    <br> <br> 
It looks like Merry Carter (m. Cordelia and Caltha THOMAS, sisters of 3rd g grandfather Marine D. THOMAS) had ?inherited considerable estate by 1860, Hopewell (Hollywood) Maury Co TN: Real Estate $6,200, Personal Estate $5,277 on census at site of Capt Wm THOMAS (father of Marine D./Caltha...) house.  
    <br> <br> 
Daughter of Capt Wm THOMAS, Mary, m. Wm Crume *(4) 1789 and moved Nelson Co KY. He died 1795, Mary received land 1797 on Mill Cr E of Bardstown,
    she then remarried Samuel Horsley (Hasley) 1798. Descendants moved TN, ARK, TX:
    e.g. Samuel Hasley of Bell Co TX and Baylor's Regiment, Texas Cavalry (2nd Regiment, Arizona Brigade) CSA... 
    <b>DNA Test Match 2020</b> to cousin whose mother was a CRUM, may be on this line.
    <br> <br> 
Daughter of Capt Wm THOMAS, Priscilla Ursula, m. (2) Lt Wm Dillard Turner (War of 1812, TN). 
    <br> <br> 
2nd wife of Capt Wm THOMAS, ?Unknown Duvall (?b. MD ca 1775), was ?probably an undocumented daughter of Cornelius and Keziah Duvall Duvall of Scott Co KY. 
    These 2 were cousins, descendants of the original French Huguenot Mareen Duvall (ca 1625-1694), and both of their fathers were named Mareen Duvall. Son of Capt Wm THOMAS was ancestor Marine Duvall THOMAS b. KY 1802.   
    <br> <br>
Ancestor Captain William THOMAS listed in estate sale of son-in-law James Mathis (m. Miriam THOMAS),  September 5,1827, Bradley Cr area E of Lascassas NE Rutherford Co TN.    
    <br> <br>
After studying the Battle of Shiloh, it seems most likely? that maternal cousin Capt Joseph E. Emerson was mortally wounded about ?afternoon Sun April 6, 1862 in fighting at the "Hornets Nest" 
    with Co E of the 3rd KY CSA. He died the next day, Monday, maybe about 2 PM next to Shiloh Church. Also with the Kentucky Confederates at Shiloh
    was Colonel Robert P. Trabue, grandson of Daniel Trabue who received a commision as militia Captain with ancestor Capt William THOMAS,
    1792 Woodford Co KY.
        <br> <br>
From My Father, Daniel Boone - The Draper Interviews with Nathan Boone (p. 104): " In Oct 1796... we started on the bear hunt up Sandy River... Our party included a couple of young gentlemen named BARLOW & DUVAL from Paris, KY who had been brought up at their ease. They went along for a woods pleasure excursion... Young BARLOW & DUVAL ate plentifully of the green apples with a generous amount of old Monongahela & got quite sick." 
The DUVAL that accompanied Daniel  BOONE & his son Nathan Bonne (15 slaves 1850 Greene Co MO) was very likely Mareen DUVALL (ca 1775-1844), son of Cornelius & Keziah DUVALL of Scott Co KY & ?brother of 4th g grandmother ? DUVALL THOMAS. Mareen m. Martha 'Patsy' West (dau of John) 1795 Bourbon Co...
From Findagrave: Margaret West BARLOW, "She married first on 9 Feb 1792, Nicholas Co., KY to Thompkins BARLOW [b.c. 1765?, VA; d. 1814, Bourbon Co., KY; son of Thomas Barlow II and Elizabeth Carlton]. " 28 June 1796 Bourbon Co (associated) land deed, wit. MAREEN DUVALL...

"Samuel's father, William Henry BARLOW, explored Kentucky with Daniel Boone..."
    <br> <br>
Possibility that the Quaker REESE family associated with the THOMASes could be descended from Reese Ap John, of Mydvai or Morthvey,
    county Carmarthen Wales, who himself descended from the Meddygon Mydavi (legendary "Physicians of Myddfai"), who owned estates there in the year 1220 AD.   
        <br> <br>
William Gideon THOMAS, a son of 4th great grandfather Capt William THOMAS, married 1801 Frances Vaught. Frances was b. Gooney Run Shenandoah Co VA (now Warren Co), d. Rutherford Co TN near Milton.
    It ?appears she was the 1st cousin once removed of Nathan Vaught (b. 1799 Shenandoah Co VA, moved 1804 Rutherford Co TN, d. Maury Co TN 1880), "Master Builder of Maury Co TN". He built the fine antebellum southern mansions of 
    Clifton Place, Elm Springs (now headquarters of Sons of Confederate Veterans), Walnut Grove, Pillow Place, etc... in Maury Co.
    <br> <br>
Isaac POTTS (1750-1803, House served as George Washington HQ Valley Forge PA 1777) and Samuel POTTS (1736-1801, Loudoun Co VA, m. Eliz THOMAS Aunt of Col Jonas THOMAS, 
    of Maury Co TN) were cousins. Mutual descent from Thomas POTTS (1632-1673, Welsh Quaker m. Eliz Basset). POTTS family were ironmasters, also had 
    Pottsgrove Manor PA. https://mercuryone.org/isaac-potts/
    <br> <br>
Note that the mother of Sir Rhys ap Thomas (1449–1525) was Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Gruffydd of Abermarlais, Carmarthenshire. This place is very near 
    Myddfai where the origins of ?related branch of REESE family appear to be.
        <br> <br>
?There seems to be some discrepancy in the reading of the will of Katherine Howard, d. 1554. The version I was using for indicating descent from Sir Rhys ap Thomas 
     is https://wc.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=royalexcesses&id=I44577:
    "The will of Katharine, Countess of Bridgwater, dated 25 Mar. 1554 (Prerogative Court of Canterbury, filed will 1 Mary]...[page updated 2016]...
     Son Henry pryce, £6.13.4 ..." This appears to be wrong, so there is no link to the REESE family I am aware of.
    <br>
Documented probable REESE family origin (related to ?ancestor David REES (Price), associate of ?ancestor Evan THOMAS of Llanycefn, d. 1706 PA, m. Eleanor Lloyd): "[near Myddfai, Carmarthenshire Wales on River Towy] GLANTOWY: a farm of 142 acres (1839)... 
The first person known to have lived there is James Price ["Gentleman"] who is described in 1684 as a 'giddy brained Quaker'. He is buried at what was the Quaker grave-garden in Llandovery. 
     His son Rees Price ["Esquire"] was an attorney who also lived at Glantowy and owned a number of properties; it was he who purchased Cilgwyn where his son James Price ["Esquire"] resided..."

Probable ancestor? Sir William MATHEW of Radyr (Glamorgan Wales): knighted on Bosworth Field 1485 by Earl of Richmond, d. 1528. 1/2 brother Morgan was 
    ancestor of MATHEW of Sweldon (family m. ancestor LLEWELYN of Rhydlafar); sister Jenet m. Sir Rhys ap Thomas (1449-1525) who was friend and associate; daughter Catherine m. Lewis LLEWELYN (family m. ancestors THOMAS of Llanbradach) of Rhydlafar.

Ednyfed Fychan (c. 1170 – 1246): soldier and counselor to Llewellyn the Great, Prince of north Wales in 1200's; was ancestor of probable blood 
    relations Sir Rhys ap Thomas, Griffith of Penrhyn, BOWEN of Llwyngwair, Sir Rhys ap Gruffydd (d. 1356; desc from Gwenllian m. Ednyfed Fychan, dau of 'THE LORD RHYS') "the wealthiest and most influential figure among the native [Welsh] gentry of the 14th century";

    Ifor Bach (ancestor of LEWIS of Van), grandson Rhys ap Griffith married Ellen or Eleanor, daughter of the LORD RHYS (1132-97), THE LORD RHYS paternally descended from RHODRI MAWR. Gwenllian (dau of LORD RHYS) m. Ednyfed Fychan (see above). Ifor Bach m. Nest, sister of LORD RHYS (source Brut Y Saeson) etc... 
Ivor, Gen. V of MORGAN of Tredegar, m. Tanglwst dau of Howel Sais son of THE LORD RHYS. Ivor's son Llewelyn Lleia m. Susan, dau of Howel ap Howel Sais son of THE LORD RHYS, a 1st cousin....    
            <br> <br>  
Probable Ancestor: Dame Jenet MATHEW, wife of Sir Rhys ap Thomas, through her 1st husband Thomas STRADLING of St Donats Castle Glamorgan. 
His grandfather was Sir Edward Stradling who married a daughter of Henry VI's great uncle Cardinal Beaufort. Sir Edward's son was 
Sir Harry Stradling who was held ransom by the Breton pirate Colyn Dolphyn in 1449. Jenet's granddaughter was Elizabeth STRADLING who m. Edmond MORGAN 
    of Penyllwyn Sarth/Bedwelty and was mother to Mary MORGAN, grandmother of ancestor Richard THOMAS of Llanbradach/Pembroke. <br> 
    The Welsh gentry were highly intermarried over hundreds of years, and there could be over a ?million ancestors 20 generations ago ca 1500 (https://blog.eogn.com/2018/01/26/how-many-ancestors-do-you-have/). 
<strong> *** <i>Note </strong>that the Welsh Quakers of Pennsylvania with surname THOMAS, descended from THOMAS of Llanbradach as documented by Rees THOMAS (m. Aubrey), 
look to be the only possible family to be ancestors of 4 of the associated THOMAS families of southern Maury Co TN in early 19th century (see detailed genealogy, Rootsweb).</i><b> *** </b> <br>
Source: Limbus Patrum... G.T. Clark.       
<br> <br>    
The pedigree of THOMAS of Llanbradach in Limbus Patrum by G.T. Clark (p. 31) is ?probably fictitious prior to about Gen. XII in the early 1400's. 
Perhaps a better, alternative origin, would possibly be as a branch of MORGAN of Tredegar (p. 310). Namely, DAVID ap Jevan (Gen. XI ca. 1415-48) ap Llewelyn ap MORGAN. 
He could correspond to DAVID ap Jevan of Llanbradach (Gen. XII) who m. Maud dau of MORGAN ap Llewelyn of Tredegar. Both families also had 
common ties to Lewis of Rhiwperra (p.34).

SOLUTION to REES/PRICE Family Genealogy (Ancestor David REESE/PRICE), from https://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/GHP/HelpPagepearlsCarmarthen :
    <br> 
    Quakers: Pryse / Pryce / Price family: Glan Towy, Cilgwyn, Dugoedydd, Ystradffin, Mandinam
    <br>
The following establishes a connection between the Pryse / Pryce / Price familes of: Glan Towy, Cilgwyn and Ystradffin which was not previously in the public domain:
    <br>
 The Lort muniments (Schedule of the Lort Muniments, County Record Office, Carmarthenshire https://archive.org/details/casLort) 1660 indicate that Richard Price (of Cwm Dynant - Wooding notes) took over the lease on the Ystradffin estate and was at the time accompanied by his two sons Edward and Rowland, both minors.
 Rowland Price of Dugoedydd in his will (Will of Rowland Pryse. NLW, Neuadd-fawr Estate Records, file 334) also refers to his brother Edward Price and his cousin Rees Price of Glan Towy.
 Edward price (of Ystradffin) was High Sheriff of Cardiganshire in 1724 (The London Gazette No. 6231. Sheriff appointments for 1724 https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/6231/page/1    &   
https://archive.org/details/listofsheriffsfo00newy/page/n3/mode/2up  page 243 ).
 Edward's daughter Mary (of Ystradffin / Mandinam) in her will (Will of Mary Lloyd https://en.powys.gov.uk/media/1114/R_D_LEW_01_bi/pdf/R_D_LEW_01_bi.pdf?m=1513612802243 ) refers to her uncle Rowland of Dugoedydd and her kinsman Rees Price of Glan Towy Attorney at Law.\
 Daniel B James, in his book Myddfai its Lands and Peoples, describes this cousin Rees and his father James in relation to Glan Towy as:


 The first person to have lived there is <b>James Price who is described in the 1684 return as a ‘giddy brained Quaker</b> and a rail rag to the church. It is further recorded that he did not attend church.’ He is buried at what was the Quaker grave-garden in Llandovery. His son Rees Price was an attorney who also lived at Glan Towy and owned a number of properties; it was he who purchased Cilgwyn Manor Myddfai where his son James Price resided.


 The will of James Price Quaker (Will of James Price. NLW, SD/1709/178 https://journals.library.wales/browse/1380216/ ) also refers to his cousin Rowland Price of Digoedith. The Quaker burial record for Llandovery indicates James Price was buried there in 1709.

    This link probably includes 4th g grandfather Capt Wm THOMAS, his ?sister Susan THOMAS (m. Capt Wm OVERALL, killed by Indians), his ?sister Anne THOMAS ("a Quaker", m. Nathaniel OVERALL), ?cousin Joshua THOMAS (m. Nancy OVERALL, killed by Indians), and all the presumed Capt Wm THOMAS children of Rutherford Co TN E of Lascassas, etc... 
It appears to me at this time that the descent of these OVERALLS is actually from Capt Wm OVERALL and SUSAN THOMAS ...

    Found match from <b>DNA test</b> on Ancestry.com to Richard THOMAS (b. ca 1772 VA, d. 1842 Paris TX, son of Capt Wm THOMAS, 1/2 brother of 3rd g grandfather Marine Duvall THOMAS). Also proven DNA link to 
    his younger sister Elizabeth THOMAS (b. 1792 KY, m. Emerson, gmother of Capt Joe Emerson, CSA).
    <br> <br>
?Found match from <b>DNA test</b> to line of Jacob THOMAS (m. Brevard, Welsh Quaker?, of PA and NC), ancestor of James Houston THOMAS (law partner of President James K Polk Columbia TN 1843). 
May confirm original hypothesis that James Houston THOMAS and his father Isaac Jetton THOMAS were both neighbors and cousins in southern Maury Co TN early 1800's to 4th g grandfather Capt Wm THOMAS. 
There is a possibility that Jacob (b. ca 1727) was a son of John THOMAS of Hopewell VA, son of Evan, and ?therefore brother of Job THOMAS of Royal Oaks Plantation VA and Wm I (?father of Capt Wm THOMAS). Jacob was documented (see Carolina Cradle)
in both Cecil Co MD and the northern Shenandoah Valley VA (with a relative named John THOMAS) ca 1750, the migration path of Evan THOMAS. Jacob also thought to have origins in the Philadelphia PA area and/or Delaware, and descendants have Welsh Y-DNA. Alternatively, could be 
a descendant of James THOMAS of Merion PA and Llanboidy Wales, a probable descendant of THOMAS of Llanbradach Wales. In either case they are all probably paternal blood kin...

!Found <b>DNA MATCH 2020</b> (15 cM 1 segment) to descendant of the THOMAS line of Glendale, Maury Co TN, previously thought not to be related. Claim descent from John (1746-1803) and Sarah Humphrey THOMAS, pioneers of Davidson Co TN, 
    through their son Benjamin (1768-1849 b. MD) and his son Alfred W. THOMAS. Sarah THOMAS Brown (dau of John and Sarah Humphrey THOMAS, m. Col Joseph Brown) was 1 of the 5 lines of THOMAS originally hypothesized to be cousins of Capt Wm THOMAS, southern Maury Co TN early 19th cent. They have a proven 
    lineage to early Welsh Quakers of Phila. PA, perhaps ?maternal cousins through THOMAS alias Prydderch line. On the other hand, they could be wrong (no Benjamin on John THOMAS 1803 Will) about descent from John and Sarah Humphrey THOMAS, and 
instead be descendants of Benjamin THOMAS, son of Daniel THOMAS of Abingdon PA b. 1678, son of (?ancestor) Evan THOMAS of Llanycefn Wales/Haverford PA d. ca 1685 (distant relationship)... Ancestor Capt Wm THOMAS 
    attended a "log rolling" for Benjamin THOMAS, ca 1811 Maury Co TN.
