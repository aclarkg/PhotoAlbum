<h2>James William CLARK (1862-1940)</h2>
<br><br>
Dominant bloodline on his mother's side (Thomas). One of his "well to do" Thomas lawyer cousins visited him 1930. The Clarks lived north of Bowie on Highway 59. Stroked out on hot summer day 1940 walking the lane from Highway 59 to his house. The "beau of the county" circa 1880's? according to Hylma Clark Kirkland. Nickname 'Buck'. ?Seeming family resemblance between photos of him & some of descendants of Job H Thomas in Maury Co Tn ... Had malaria while a youth in TN. The Clark's move to TX ca 1878 was at least in part motivated by health considerations (stated by Hylma Clark Kirkland)  because of the malaria, but might also have been influenced by the 1878 Yellow Fever epidemic in the lower Mississippi valley... Both the Clark & Garrett places in west Tennessee were owned by family matriarchs 1870 (Jane E Poole Clark & Eleanor Rhodes Garrett)... Buck said of boyhood in NW TN: swam in swimming hole, ... , had negro cook - favored biscuits with molasses * & butter, ?gingerbread or molasses cookies, ate peas with a knife 19th century style; strong memory of crossing the Mississippi River ca 1878 going to Texas; had Thomas Welsh characteristics of dark hair & eyes, fair complexion, long face, handlebar moustache his adult life; looks to be from his pictures maybe 3/4 or more on the Welsh/Thomas lines; handsome, distinguished, aristocratic southern gentleman ... His farm on Highway 59 near Bowie: some cotton probably til Boll Weevil early 1920's? (they said cotton grew very tall when 1st planted early 1880's on the headwaters of Denton Creek, virgin soil), peach orchard,  watermelons, milk cows, chickens, a Collie dog at some point... Since the censuses have Buck as being born in Kentucky & he seems to have told everybody he was from Kentucky (although raised in TN), it would be reasonable to think he was probably born at his grandfather Marine D. Thomas' "plantation" , as they called them, southwest of Felciana. His mother Nancy would have been living there just 3 years previously before she was married in May 1859.

From Nancy Ann THOMAS notes: "REES THOMAS [m. Martha Aubrey] attended [Welsh] QUAKER wedding of Anthony MORRIS dau Mary to Samuel POWELL [I] 1732 [Phila.]." Son of this Samuel & Mary Morris Powell I was Samuel Powell II (1738-1793, m. 1769 Eliza. Willing). Mother of Israel MORRIS (1741-1806, ?cousin of CAPT WM THOMAS at Bentonville VA ca 1771-1774, had land Haverford PA 1774) was Sarah Powell, sister of Samuel Powell I, while the father of Israel MORRIS was Anthony Morris, brother to Mary Morris Powell. Eliza Powell ("the premiere Saloniste of Phila."), wife of Samuel Powel II ("one of Philadelphia's wealthiest", Mayor; met Voltaire, the Pope, and the Duke of York; pallbearer at Ben Franklin's funeral, good friend to George Washington, visited Mt Vernon many times, died Yellow Fever epidemic 1793, buried Christ Church) held "Sinful Feast" Thursday Sept 8, 1774 at the now historic landmark Powel House, 244 S. 3rd St in Philadelphia as seen on "A Taste of History", PBS. Israel Morris was the double 1st cousin of Samuel Powel II.
<br><br>
From MORRIS Family of Phila. by Robt C. Moon: 1777 letter from Capt Samuel Morris of Phila. Light Horse refers to brother "Issy" (Israel), who'd had "nervous fever"... Gen'l George Washington often kept a place at his table ready for Capt Samuel Morris during the Revolution. Recall that most of George Washington's Presidency was spent in the US capital of Philadelphia, he moved there 1790 "with a large staff of servants & slaves"... Samuel & Israel were brothers of Major Anthony Morris, killed Battle of Princeton NJ 1777...Israel's wife Mary Harrison died after a year of marriage ca 1775 (married 13 JUN 1774, Haddonfield Quaker MM, Camden, New Jersey)...

Cumb. Co VA Chancery Court (?hard to read) -  Job THOMAS vs French 1771, refers to his ?rebuilt MILL on Randolph Cr (?=Trenton Mills just N of Royal Oaks Plantation, which is now surrounded by State Forest on Willis River); ? Phineas & Ann Price THOMAS vs exec of Jos Price 1787-9, p. 22 "the said Phineas THOMAS answered his father [Job] wanted it to give to his sons in Maryland..." ("Job THOMAS left his 2 sons Jesse & Phineas & wife Eliz Hoggatt [b. 1721, m. ca? 1749] on Royal Oaks, went on a [very] Long Hunt (?western VA), & had another family by a Miss Crow (MD?)...he returned & said to his wife 'I thought you were dead' ")...

Possible Capt Wm THOMAS relation (cousin?): Wm Thomas 600 acres Eagle Cr 1785 Fayette (now Carroll?) Co KY; Deed transaction by Wm Thomas of Gallatin (now Carroll?)

Eagle Station (Eagle Cr) Gallatin (became Carroll Co 1838) Co KY... Carroll County was strongly pro-Confederate during the Civil War: only 2.7 percent of its white population volunteered to serve in the Union Army, which constitutes the 14th-lowest of 109 counties of KY extant as of the 1860 election (from Copeland, Where Were the Kentucky Unionists and Secessionists;  Register of Ky Hist Soc).

! From the Ency Brit Vol 11 p 703 concerning heraldry: "Spear Head-This is a common bearing among the Welsh of Glamorgan & Brecknock...: sable, a chevron between 3 spear heads argent, points embrued gules. It is quartered by LEWIS of Greenmeadow, a cadet of VAN, & by others". From genealogy.com: "The heraldic seal was affixed to the will of William Lewis, ?son of William Lewis, the immigrant. The will was probated in Chester Co, Penn in 1707. 
Note: This seal was the arms of the Glamorganshire Lewises to whom William and Ralph Lewis belonged. Lewis of Glamorganshire had: Arms - Sable, a chevron between three spear heads argent, embrued gules. Crest: None." Indication that the PA/Wales Lewises desc from LEWIS of VAN. These coat of arms also similar to LEWIS of Llanishen, desc of VAN.

300 acres of Bryn Mawr Farm (now Harriton House near Phila PA built 1704) bought from quaker Rowland Ellis by Rees THOMAS (m.

Note that Rees was reasonably documented as desc of THOMAS of Llanbradach & that his uncle was Wm THOMAS of LLlanddewi Velfrey Pembroke (& Machynlleth) Wales & Radnor PA. Also, that LEWIS David (aka David LEWIS in PA will) of Llanddewi & PA was prob desc of VAN, possibly a bro of above named Ralph & Wm LEWIS of Eglwysilan Wales & PA.
<br><br>
?Speculation: Thomas THOMAS was the name of 1 of the known sons of Daniel THOMAS II of Abington PA, maybe also the name of his paternal gfather, ?son of Richard THOMAS of Llanbradach, & bro to Wm (of Llanddewi) & John (father of Rees) THOMAS. Evan of Hopewell's father was ?prob Evan THOMAS of Llanycefn Wales... Related James THOMAS of Llanboidy Wales & Merion PA also named a son Thomas THOMAS... Richard of Llanbradach's bro was Thomas THOMAS (m. Carew, d. 1667), Esquire of Llanbradach & Rhydlavar. This connection to the Carews (had Carew Castle in Pembroke) could have been a reason why Richard THOMAS & LEWIS David moved to Pembroke...
