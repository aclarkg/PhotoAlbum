* NE Wales Border = old South Rheged territory of Brittonic Celts NE of Liverpool (Lancashire). DNA indicates that the maternal THOMAS lines may have lived not only in what is now modern Wales in very olden times, but also the areas of Cornwall & Lancashire (South Rheged, "the Old North" of the Britons). Last King of South Rheged d. 634 (Llywarch Hen). This fits on presumed ancestral THOMAS/REES line: grandson of Sir Rhys ap Thomas (aka Sir REES ap Thomas) claimed ancestry from Urien Rheged, King of North Rheged d. 586, & Welsh folk hero from poems by Taliesin (fl 6th cent CE) who sang in the courts of Powys & Rheged. For this, claiming Kingship of Wales, he was executed by Henry VIII. " Rhys ap Griffith (1508-1531), who was later executed by Henry VIII ... as he was considered a threat to Henry VIII and was executed for treason ... (purportedly for inscribing the name 'Fitz Uryan' on his armor)." ... Some historians think the son (Llywarch Hen) of the brother (Elidir Lydanwyn="the stout & handsome") of Urien Rheged's father (Cynfarch Oer) became ruler of south Rheged & later moved down into Powys Wales. This could have been part of the REES's ancestry. LlYWARCH HEN (descended from Coel Hen aka Old King Cole, fl. early 5th cent?) was an ancestor of RHODRI MAWR. Therefore, THOMAS of Llanbradach, REES, LEWIS of Van, MORGAN of Tredegar, ?all descendants of the family of the LORD RHYS, were descendants of Rhodri Mawr & the family of URIEN RHEGED.

**  Tradition says the GARRETTs came to America from Leicestershire in the 1600's. DNA indicates either SE England (Middlesex on some genealogies likely before Leicestershire?, since it has highest DNA % at 36.1 %) near London or Yorkshire as their main origin, which coincides with Forebears website of the places with greatest incidence of the surname in England.
<br><br>
*** 1 source says the WILCOXes orginated in the Bristol, England area, which coincides with Forebears website of 1 of the places with greatest incidence of the surname in England (Gloucestershire). However, less DNA shows up from here. Other counties that are possibilities are Yorkshire & Lincolnshire, which have higher DNA & high incidence of the surname. Red hair has highest incidence towards Scotland (13 % of population).
<br><br>
* (4) It is possible some of the E Anglia/SE England DNA could have been the Dutch GULICK  or German CURTNER, etc...
<br><br>
* (5) Possibilities for the North of England DNA include HALL, ... Other DNA - paternal Quaker COPPOCKS (Saxon?) of (Aaron) Mobberly, Cheshire England & (Joseph) 1677 Quaker Meeting at Franley Lancashire, probably part of NE Wales Borders (NW England) %. BYRDs also had ancestral roots in Cheshire, though they moved to London.
<br><br>
* (6) JOB and HUSBAND are the only surnames on either Father or Mother side thus far that indicate any Cornish roots. Ancestry.com surname distribution map shows Cornwall as most common origin of JOB, & may imply correctness of THOMAS genealogy somewhat.
