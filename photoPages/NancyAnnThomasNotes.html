<h2>Nancy Ann THOMAS (1838-1912)</h2>
<br><br>
From tombstone: "Mother, thou has flown from us to the region far above us. We to thee erect this stone consecrated by our love." ?Said to be not that handy as a housekeeper because of growing up with slaves; but loved by her son James William 'Buck' Clark who cried while pacing around his house when she died (Source: Hylma Clark Kirkland). Imogene Clark Garrett visited her on her deathbed 1912, at Jno Clark house - "the house had a frame & a cabin part, she was lieing on the bed in the cabin part, but didn't know anything". Sounds like she might have had a stroke.

Since other members of the Welsh Quaker gentry families attended Oxford University (Aubrey, Bevan, Lloyds of Dolobran...) it might be speculated that Wm Howell, stepfather of Evan THOMAS of Hopewell ("educated in profession of the Church of England"), sent Evan to school there ca 1700:  "From the beginnings of the Church of England as the established church til 1866, membership of the church was a requirement to receive the BA degree from the [Oxford] university...", according to the Articles of Faith of the Established Church. Interesting to note that John Thomas of Hopewell VA & Guilford Co NC, Evans' favored son by his will, looks to be illiterate.

The castle had reverted to Sir John after it had been sold to Sir Rhys ap Thomas in the 15th cent. At the Restoration (1660) the castle was returned to the ?Sir George de Carews, who continued to occupy the eastern wing until 1686.  Carew Tidal MILL next to castle - "in a commission of 1630 ... indicates that SIR JOHN CAREW had restored the floodgates and causeway walls some 15 years earlier". Dorothy's other bro, also named Sir John Carew, lived in Camerton (sw of Bath), Somersetshire.

"EVAN THOMAS [of Llanykeaven], who by deed, dated 10 May, 1683, purchased 250 acres of LEWIS DAVID [tract in Haverford Penn]." - this suggests a link of relation (1st cousins?) to Wm Thomas of Llanddewi (Lewis David tract owners named THOMAS "prob related to Wm THOMAS of Llanddewi Wales" - from Salmon), assoc of LEWIS DAVID there, & possible Uncle of REES THOMAS. In 1700 EVAN THOMAS heirs sold 75 acres of this land to NATHAN THOMAS (son of JAMES I?), & the original 3000 acre tract of LEWIS DAVID was resurveyed 1701. Also in 1700 Lewis David sold a lot & grist mill in Haverford Twp to WM HOWELL [who sold it to Rowland Powell]. Lewis David held in addition about 190 acres in Dyffrin Mawr Twp...

From Elegy to Martha Aubrey THOMAS, d. Dec 7, 1726-7,  wife of Rees of Merion PA:
As her life was righteous, so her death was sweet, & the father of mercies
was graciously pleased, (according to her desire) to favour her with her
senses, even to her last moments. When her departure drew near, being
asked by her husband, " how it was with her," she answered, " she had nothing
to obstruct her (implying her perfect resignation & peace of soul),
& that ever since she had been in this country, (which was about thirty-five years), she never had strife with any one", tenderly & affectionately
advising her children to walk in the ways of God, & strictly to keep to
meetings, which she, in a dying hour, had found so much comfort and
sweetness in.
May all her friends & relations, her servants & children, endeavour to
imitate her virtues, that as she lived, they may live; & as she died, they
may die, in peace, joy, & love.

"When I was clear of Bristol, the Lord having blessed me & preserved
me so far in my journey, I set forward towards Pembroke. ...
So I came to the house of our Friend LEWIS Davies [DAVID, of Llanddewi
Velfrey], ... Staying there
some time they lent me a horse to go to a mtg at REDSTONE [abt
1 m. north of Narberth Castle], & I left my own horse behind me,
thinking he might rest for some days after my hard riding... & I had several brave mtgs in Haverforwest
& other places in the county. The last I had was at [Puncheston] among the Welsh... & I stood with my back towards THOMAS
Simmon's [SIMONS] wall of his house...At last I called to the Friend, whose name was
THOMAS SIMMONS, & to his wife, & desired them to rise and let
us come in. He asked me who was there. I told him in Welsh, Richard
Davies was there. ' What,' said he, ' Richard Davies of Welshpool ?
' I told him I was the man. Thereupon the tender loving Friends
hastily came down & let us into their house, & we were satisfied
in the love of God. . . ." On their way home Davies ... had a mtg at
Newcastle Emlyn, whither they were accompanied by
James LEWIS (of Llanddewi, son of LEWIS DAVID), Peregrine MUSGRAVE &
other Friends.
