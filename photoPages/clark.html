      <h3>James William "Buck" Clark, 1894</h3>
      <h4>b. 1862 ?Feliciana, Graves Co KY d. 1940 near Bowie, TX. 
        Principal genetic ancestor, maternal great grandfather. 
        Southern thoroughbred descended from British gentry
         on both father and mother (THOMAS, his strongly dominant bloodline) sides.
         Direct paternal descendant of colonial Virginia planter Captain Christopher <b>CLARK</b> (b. ca 1681 VA, son of Micajah And Sallie Ann MOORMAN CLARK, gson of Michael & Margaret 
          (1679 Christ Church Parish Barbados, 167 acres 5 White Servants 78 Blacks, late 16oo's Barbados - "Clark men, gentlemen of nobility") CLARK) & Penelope Johnson?.
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Penelope Johnson vs Bolling?: the birthdate of Aug 4 1684, St Peter's Parish
New Kent Co Virginia, looks valid for Penelope as daughter of Edward (b. Aberdeenshire Scotland, probable descent from Johnston of Caskieben & Clan Johnstone of Annandale, Quaker links...) & 
          Eliz [Walker] Johnson. Capt Christopher CLARK & Penelope <b>JOHNSON</b> would probably have attended ca 1700 Black Creek Friends Meeting, St Peters Parish New Kent Co VA, together. "Immigrant [Col] Robt Bolling's (1646-1709) grandmother was Anne 
Clarke, daughter of London merchant Thomas Clarke whose Clarke roots go back to 
Yorkshire. That much is documented in the 1633-34 London Visitation journal.   
That might be the connection that produced the "Bolling" name in the Christopher 
Clark family. (I should add that this is the same Thomas Clarke, London 
merchant, who shows up in the land records of widow Margaret Clarke of 
Barbados)."<br>
